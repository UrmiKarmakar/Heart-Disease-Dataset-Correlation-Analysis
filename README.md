# Heart-Disease-Dataset-Correlation-Analysis-and-Visualization
This project explores correlations in the Heart Disease Dataset using Pearson and Chi-Squared methods. The analysis includes data preprocessing, correlation calculation, and insightful visualizations

Also, this repository visualizes the Heart Disease dataset with univariate histograms (mean, median, mode, skewness), bar graphs, box plots, multivariate scatter plots, violin plots, radar charts, and line graphs.
